collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a novel fast and asynchronous event-based corner detection method which is called FA-Harris. FA-Harris consists of several components, including an event filter, a Global Surface of Active Events (G-SAE) maintaining unit, a corner candidate selecting unit, and a corner candidate refining unit.'

In this paper, we propose a novel fast and asynchronous event-based corner detection method which is called FA-Harris. FA-Harris consists of several components, including an event filter, a Global Surface of Active Events (G-SAE) maintaining unit, a corner candidate selecting unit, and a corner candidate refining unit.
