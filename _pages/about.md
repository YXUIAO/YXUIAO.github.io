I am a postgraduate at State Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Processing, [National University of Defense Technology](https://english.nudt.edu.cn), Changsha, China. I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Internet of Things from [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/), Shenyang, China. When I was a sophomore undergraguate, I participated in two robot competitions (one of which is [ABU Robocon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon)), which helped me a lot in improving programming and analytical ability. Since then, I have been interested in robotics and computer vision. I joined National University of Defense Technology in 2017, and became part of State Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Processing, supervised by Prof. Dr. Dianxi Shi and [Dr. Ruihao Li.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WI_78PwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) My current research focuses on visual SLAM and event-based SLAM.
