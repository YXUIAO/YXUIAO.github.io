I am a postgraduate at State Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Processing, [National University of Defense Technology](https://english.nudt.edu.cn), Changsha, China. When I was a sophomore undergraguate, I participated in two robot competitions (one of which is [ABU Robocon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon)), which helped me a lot in improving programming and analytical ability. Since then, I have been interested in robotics and computer vision. My current research focuses on visual SLAM and event-based SLAM.
